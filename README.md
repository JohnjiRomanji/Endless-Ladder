# Endless-Ladder

A (definetly not absolutely useless ðŸ‘€) endless scrolling website! 

The website includes a score counter for the amount of little taunting people you ahve crossed and the amount you have scrolled. 

A backend API has been setup to store a global top score between players. 

Can you beat the top score?
